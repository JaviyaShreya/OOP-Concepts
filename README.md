What is OOP?

OOP organises code around object rather than logic and functions.
OOP is a programming paradigm based on concept of object , which represents real world entities.

There are 4 main pillars of OOP
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritence
4. Polymorphism

Class :- Class is a blueprint thta is used to create objects.

Object :- Object is specific instance created from class. It has its own state of proprties defined by class.

Abstraction :- Abstraction is the the ability to hide complex implementation details and show only the necessary features of an object.

Encapsulation :- Encapsulation is a way to group data and the methods that operate on it into a single unit. 

Inheritence :- Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. 

Polymorphism :- Polymorphism describes the ability of something to have or to be displayed in more than one form. 

-> OOP uses bottom-up approach
